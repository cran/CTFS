Authors of CTFS 

The CTFS functions for analysis of tropical forest structure, dynamics and 
diversity were originally written for and during annual workshops held for 
5 years (2001-2005).  The initial primary authors included Rick Condit, 
Kyle Harms, Suzanne Lao, Akira Itoh and Pamela Hall.  The participants in 
the workshops and other collaborators have contributed to this collection 
of functions over the years.  CTFS is a part of the Smithsonian Tropical 
Research Institute (STRI).

These workshops were funded by the US National Science Foundation and
institutions at which they were held: Bangalor(2001), Panama-STRI(2002) Harvard Forest(2003),
Tawian(2004) and Panama-STRI(2005).
